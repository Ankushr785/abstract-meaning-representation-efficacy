"A: Hi Tom, are you busy tomorrow’s afternoon?
B: I’m pretty sure I am. What’s up?
A: Can you go with me to the animal shelter?.
B: What do you want to do?
A: I want to get a puppy for my son.
B: That will make him so happy.
A: Yeah, we’ve discussed it many times. I think he’s ready now.
B: That’s good. Raising a dog is a tough issue. Like having a baby ;-) 
A: I'll get him one of those little dogs.
B: One that won't grow up too big;-)
A: And eat too much;-))
B: Do you know which one he would like?
A: Oh, yes, I took him there last Monday. He showed me one that he really liked.
B: I bet you had to drag him away.
A: He wanted to take it home right away ;-).
B: I wonder what he'll name it.
A: He said he’d name it after his dead hamster – Lemmy  - he's  a great Motorhead fan :-)))","# ::tok A : Hi Tom , are you busy tomorrow’s afternoon ? B : I’m pretty sure I am . What’s up ?

"Luigi: Geez, Mayweather totally destroyed McGregor! Did you watch gentlemen??
Lorenzo: I'm not very much into boxing, rather prefer MMA but the buzz about this fight made me watch it
Lorenzo: And yeah, the black guy seemed to be only defending himself for a few rounds but at the same time Conor lost much of his stamina
Pablo: Whatta hell are you two talking about??
Pablo: McGregor and boxing?? He's an mma warrior, those R 2 different worlds! Wtf
Pablo: And Mayweather?? He's fuckin 40, he's to fuckin old to fight!
Luigi: Hahaha Pablito :D
Luigi: You follow UFC events and you know mcgregor's a freak and likes to provoke people
Pablo: Aight but those R people from mma that he provokes, not from fuckin boxing!
Pablo: He's fuckin one unpredictable piece of bastard
Lorenzo: You better watch your mouth Pablo cause if Conor finds out what you're sayin, you'll be the next xD
Pablo: Sheit dudes, that's a fuckin nonsense
Pablo: But anyway... Mayweather won, you've said that. And McGregor? Was he sharp?
Luigi: He was, actually I was surprised cause he was fighting pretty well for 5 maybe 6 rounds
Luigi: Floyd had to keep his guard up and seemed to have little chances cuz the Irishman was attacking again an again
Luigi: But you know, Floyd is an old bird and all this time he was waiting for Conor to get tired and you know the rest :)
Pablo: Experience bitch, he beat 'The Notorious' thanks to his fuckin experience!
Luigi: No doubt about it, bro
Lorenzo: But you know, Mcgregor's never fought 10 rounds, in MMA 3 rounds is the limit
Pablo: True
Lorenzo: So what if they agreed for a rematch on the mma rules?? :)
Pablo: Duuuuuude
Pablo: Conor would destroy him, no doubt
Luigi: Who knows, maybe they've been planning two differnt fights, who knows :)
Pablo: Hope so, I'm goin to fuckin wait for the fight even if it would be at 4 am
Lorenzo: Good old Pablo... I love your temperament you son of a bitch
Pablo: Yeah, you're not the first bitch to say that

"Kyle: Who wants to go out for a drink?
Megan: No, sorry, I'm cleaning the house today.
Roseanne: You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen.
Vince: Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away.
Kyle: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust.
Megan: Remind me to never stay at your place :P
Roseanne: I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty.
Vince: What's the difference?
Roseanne: I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time. I like to have everything within my reach.
Vince: There's no better wardrobe than the armchair, right? XD
Kyle: I prefer the floor. There's more space on it :D
Megan: Just reading this gives me the creeps.
Kyle: Fine, go back to cleaning, we'll think of you while sharing a beer :D

Vince: Take them to Megan's place, they can help her clean :D
Megan: You know what? I don't care. I can watch your kids, Roseanne. Just bring them over.
Roseanne: But are you serious or just mad at us?
Megan: No, I'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D
Roseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.
Vince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D
Roseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.
Kyle: Do they pay him? :P
Roseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?
Megan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.

Christian: Thank you Isabel! How much time do we need to get to the apartment?

Erica: I'll ask around in class to see if anyone is interested in joining the group
Rachel: good luck!","# ::tok Erica : that Paul is a smart guy , is n't he ? Rachel : he is at the top of his class Erica : I 'm having trouble in calculus 101 , I wonder if he could tutor me Rachel : I can ask him for you Erica : I do n't want to give him the wrong idea , though Rachel : the wrong idea ? Rachel : what do you mean ? Erica : I do n't want him to think I want to date or anything lol Rachel : lol i see what you mean Rachel : some guys are cocky like that : - / Erica : I KNOW !! The only thing I want from him is to learn what derivatives are lol XD Rachel : lol , I do n't think he 'd get the wrong idea if you were upfront about it Rachel : just tell him you 're having trouble and need help . Period . Nothing more . Erica : mmm I 'm too shy to ask him to tutor me Erica : maybe I 'll just ask the professor for extra credit Rachel : do n't do that ! you just need a bit of help Erica : you know what , i 'll start a study group Rachel : that 's a great idea !!! Erica : yes , it 's better than asking a practical stranger to tutor me Erica : I 'll ask around in class to see if anyone is interested in joining the group Rachel : good luck !

"Fran: so how's the new affair going?;)
Sally: hmm
Fran: what happened?
Sally: I'm not sure. I mean everything is fine but there's no chemistry. Maybe there's something wrong with me
Fran: There's nothing wrong with you. Don't let yourself think that. Maybe you just need more time
Sally: It's not like I wanna give up but sometimes I wonder if I should be forcing myself
Fran: Definitely not. But maybe try not to put so much pressure on it
Sally: I just don't understand it. And myself
Fran: You don't have to understand anything :)
Sally: I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now I really don't know what happened and how to get it back
Fran: You probably started thinking too much ;)
Sally: Hahah probably. My head is my worst enemy
Fran: You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? And you're older now. It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;)
Sally: I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all
Fran: Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. They don't like it ;)
Sally: I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk
Fran: You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once
Sally: Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all
Fran: Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything. 
Sally: I'm not going to. I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things
Fran: Exactly. And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ;)

Anton: Perfect! Just give me your dates and I'll keep it booked for you.
Beryl: Would you prefer me to do it via airbnb website or just like this directly with you?
Anton: I think it'll be more advantageous for both of us to do it directly. Do you know exactly when you'll be coming?
Beryl: Not so much. Can I get back to you in 2, 3 days' time?
Anton: ASAP really. As I say we've been receiving bookings daily now.
Beryl: Well, no big deal. I'll be staying in Cape Town for a longer time and am quite flexible in my dates.
Anton: Will you be coming with Tino, if I may ask?
Beryl: No. I am single again. Hurray! So pls make it single occupancy any week in January, Anton.

"Alice: Good evening, Professor, I apologize for writing to you on Facebook but I thought that it would be the easiest and quickest way to contact you. I would like to ask if there have been any news about tomorrow's classes. Everyone is wondering whether they should come to the university tomorrow or not. Thank you in advance for any information. Kind regards, Alice
Margaret: Good evening, all classes will take place according to schedule tomorrow, so no good news for the students! :) By the way, I would really prefer if students wrote to me on my email address.
Alice: I know, I apologize
Margaret: Ok, just remember in the future.
Alice: It's just we got used to communicating with Dr. Smith via Facebook, he uses it all the time
Margaret: I know, Dr. Smith has a very informal approach, however I happen not to share his views.
Alice: Ok, sorry again, Professor!
Margaret: You know I only answered here because you are older than your fellow students, had it been one of the others I would have told the rascal to send me a proper email message. ;)
Alice: I know, I apologize once again
Margaret: No problem, see you tomorrow!
Alice: Have a nice evening
Margaret: You too.
Alice: Oh and may I ask you one more thing?
Margaret: I feel like I'm being forcibly Dr. Smith-ized here.
Alice: Sorry again...
Margaret: Ok, ok, just ask.
Alice: May I ask you if you have read the second chapter of my thesis? I hope it's good but I'm not sure...
Margaret: I haven't read all of it yet but it's pretty good so far. I will send you more feedback over the weekend, ok?
Alice: Ok, thank you very much, Professor!
Margaret: You're welcome, just use email next time, please.
Alice: I will! Kind regards
Margaret: That sounded strange in a messenger chat, but ok. Yours faithfully!
Alice: Good night, Professor :)

",Magda and Victoria feel broke. 
"Patricia: Barry!! Have you heard the news? They released a demo gameplay from Cyberpunk 2077!
Barry: What, really? Where did you see that?
Patricia: <file_video>
Barry: Holy shit, that's pretty impressive... I was pumped for the game already but now THIS is hype. Whoa.
Patricia: I know, right! I loved Wild Hunt but this is like a completely different level?
Barry: It really is. I guess we'll see when the game gets released but for once the NPCs seemed like real people, even the crowds. They said they'd be working on that and now I'm sold.
Patricia: Yeah, they didn't move awkwardly or anything, it really felt like the world was alive. I can't wait!!
Barry: It's only a shame about the POV...
Patricia: You don't like first-person?
Barry: Well, I guess it's okay at times but I'd prefer over-the-shoulder. They say you can customise everything about your character so I'd kind of like to be able to see my gear because otherwise what's the point.
Patricia: Huh... I actually haven't played first-person much, but I ended up really enjoying it in Morrowind. It felt really immersive and when I switched to third-person view for a moment, it felt strange.
Barry: Well, I'll still be hoping for an option to switch to third-person...
Patricia: I wouldn't really count on that. They seem really committed to their vision and think this is the best choice so people can enjoy the world 100%.
Barry: I'm still not sure but y'know, not gonna hate until it's actually release. It looks really good so far so I'd be happy if they proved me wrong and made me enjoy the POV.
Patricia: I just wish they'd tell us the release date already!
Barry: Hmm, who knows... I think it was supposed to be ready this year, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.","# ::tok Patricia : Barry !! Have you heard the news ?

Paul: It was not that bad. I have been able to do everything, is just that I was feeling pretty weird. And I could not really at anything.
Evelina: And what did the doctor say?
Paul: He said that is probably some indigestion as I don't have any other symptoms. No fever, vomitting or anything.
Evelina: Ok, that's good. Did he give you any medicine or something?
Paul: He gave me some herbs mix and if that does not help me told me to come back and they will do an ultrasound.
Evelina: Ok. Have you already got the medicine? 
Paul: No, not yet. I have been to a couple of pharmacies but they did not have it.

"Barney: Does anyone know where I can buy this kind of bark that orchids grow in?
Lewis: Don't tell me you've taken up gardening :D
Barney: No, I dropped my mum's favorite orchid and now I have to replant it before she comes back.
Lewis: LOL, you're so clumsy!
Judith: Wait, I'll ask my Mum.
Lewis: You can always say it was the cat's fault :P
Barney: Then she'll say it was my fault anyway because I let the cat do it.
Lewis: Do you think she won't notice that you replanted it?
Barney: I hope so :D No, but in all seriousness, I hope that if she sees I did all I could to save it, she won't be that mad. She got that bloody plant from Dad on their 25th anniversary, it means a lot to her.
Judith: I'm back.
Barney: And?
Judith: Mum says to try at The Home Depot. She buys pots for her plants there.
Barney: Thank you! I've already ordered an identical pot from Amazon, but I forgot to order that bark too, and now it's too late to buy it online. Why can't orchids grow in soil like normal plants?
Lewis: Because they're too fancy for that?
Barney: LOL, right :D Okay, thanks for help, guys.

","Mike is late, because he missed the bus. Mike and John are frustrated, because there's a shortage of employees in their workplace."
"Matty: Happy Christmas!! :D hope you're enjoying the festivities
Ella: Thanks Matty!! Merry Christmas to you too ;) How are you??? :D
Matty: I'm good thank you just sleepy haha :) how about you?
Matty: How's things going with studying
Ella: Oh dear :P What have you been up to? ;) I'm not that sleepy, even though I did get to bed late :P
Ella: Uni's hard work (no changes there), but I really like my subjects this semester - on of my subjects is Microbiology (so all on bacteria), another is on the Biochemical Pathways to Metabolic Illnesses (basically diabetes and obesity) - so, pretty cool stuff :D
Ella: WHat about you? Are you having fun?
Matty: Sounds interesting I've gotta say. Particularly the bacteria stuff! I've been on a walk today so quite tired from that. And I'm enjoying uni yeah! Very very busy. Starting dissertation stuff soon and had a lot of work for essays
Ella: Did you take any photos whilst on your walk? :D So... what does your dissertation stuff look like? Are you in any Uni groups?
Matty: Got some yeah :) posted one to Facebook. Mine is looking like geography and politics related. Not sure about uni groups? What's your dissertation on if you have to do one?
Ella: We don't really have dissertations... at the end of my third year I'll be writing my degree, so that will be like a slightly longer lab report :) Geography and politics - hmmm... that's  a pretty wide topic, I mean, you could talk about Global warming etc. right?
Matty: Aah ok. So the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it?
Matty: And it's very wide the topic. Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there
Ella: Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree :) Social and cultural stuff... like what?
Matty: Aaah cool :D I have exams too which make mine up haha. Lucky you
Matty: And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people
Ella: I meant grades from exams, so I don't know if I'm really that lucky :P That's actually really interesting! So how do you prepare for this? Do you get to interview people?
Matty: Oh right haha. And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab?
Ella: Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics
Ella: It really depends on what you're studying - Biology has a pretty large spectrum, afterall :)","# ::tok Matty : Happy Christmas !! : D hope you 're enjoying the festivities Ella : Thanks Matty !!

",Owen is looking for volunteers for an unpaid project in Toronto. All associated costs are covered. Luke might consider it.
"Dave: hi darling, you OK?
Mari: yes, but my sister's been here with the twins, Christ! What a pair of hooligans! They'd have ripped off the new wallpaper if I hadn't stopped them. Louise is hopeless!
Dave: yeah, one little thing, I'm driving up to Kidderminster with Sharon tomorrow and I really can't sort out Ethan. Can your mother take him to nursery?
Mari: yeah, sure it'll be ok. I'll ring her now. What is that woman making you do now?
Dave: Well, It's the regional marketing thing for the new campaign I've been working on. Ashley can't go, because of her arm, so Sharon asked me,
Mari: Asked you? Ordered you to do it, more like! Really Dave, you must stand up to that woman. You boss me around when you feel like it!
Dave: that's true! Anyway, Sharon says her balls are on the line with this campaign if it isn't 100% brilliant!
Mari: her balls! The cheek of the woman! It's you who will get it in the neck if it tanks, love. 
Dave: No, she wouldn't do that!
Mari: she would! She's unscrupulous! Remember old Gareth, she threw him under the bus! Come on, stand up to her, love!
Dave: Well, I could tell her I want to present the project as I worked on from from the word go. Why should she get all the credit!
Mari: That's the spirit, Dave sweetheart. She's a nasty bully. In fact, I'd have a quiet word with Ian about her. 
Dave: Yeah, he knows all her tricks! Gareth complained to him about her, but he didn't have the stomach for a fight.
Mari: Dave, tell Sharon you're in charge tomorrow and then go and see Ian in his office on Friday.
Dave: Thanks love, I don't know what I'd do without you!
Mari: It's what I'm here for, you big soft idiot!
Dave: She's undermined me far too long, it's time I took action!
Mari: I'm so pleased to hear you say that my love! I love you as a man of action!
Dave: I'm always your Action Man!
Mari: Love you xxxxxx

Hannah: Only the scratches. The rest is fine. I may send you some more photos if you wish. Basically, these are good rollerblades. I'm selling them because I got an injury. Otherwise I'd still be using them.

Hannah: Yes.

Julie: Oh, the Santa Clause films, right, I think there are three or four?
Ramsay: Yes, I forget how many.
Julie: This is a good start. More than we need probably. Any others?
Ramsay: Well, all the old Rankin Bass stop motion ones like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and The Year Without a Santa Claus.
Julie: Those are great for the kids, right?
Ramsay: I kind of like them myself! Nostalgia and all that!
Julie: LOL!
Ramsay: I'm sure there are newer ones, I just don't know them.
Julie: I think so too. Christmas with the Kranks, I think, was the chick from the Halloween films?
Ramsay: Now you're getting too modern for me!
Julie: Okay, thanks for the advice!
Ramsay: Enjoy!","# ::tok Julie : Can you give me some ideas for Christmas movies , please ? Ramsay : Well , there 's Home Alone . Julie : Oh , right !

"Michaela: So what do you guys think about the association idea?
Ron: I might be lacking the context here
Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example
Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork.
Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year.
Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person.
Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility
Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there?
Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.
Jessie: so what do we get from it really?
Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.
Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>
Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association
Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually
Michaela: I recall two as well
Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort.
Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours
Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding
Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association
Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work
Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly
Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it
Michaela: Steve?
Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now
Michaela: Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all?
Steve: yup, I can stay a bit longer
Jessie: Fine by me

Victor: Basically, yeah. Just do a search, and you'll find 'em.
Aaron: Cool.

",April wants Archibald to join her for a bike ride tomorrow. He is taking his father to a family friend's funeral and will only by available after 1 pm. April will meet him then at their usual meeting spot.
"Jody: I hate ironing!
Lynn: Me too!
Jody: Especially shirts!
Lynn: I know, that's a pain in the neck!
Jody: My hubby uses like 5 shirts a week! And all I do is iron them!
Lynn: Can't he do it himself?
Jody: Wouldn't even let him near an iron!
Lynn: Why not?
Jody: Well, mostly because the last time he did ironing, he burnt my favourite shirt and two of his own.
Lynn: How did he manage to do that?
Jody: Have no idea. Suppose he left the iron on the shirts and forgot to unplug it, but will never know. 
Lynn: Have you tried an ironing machine?
Jody: Yes, I have an iron at home. Don't need to borrow it from the neighbour.
Lynn: No, like this: <file_other>
Jody: What's this?
Lynn: An ironing machine. Useful with shirts, T-shirts and similar. 
Jody: So, how does it work?
Lynn: Not sure. Probably hot air goes through and pushes the material out so that it also irons it. 
Jody: Sounds too good to be true.
Lynn: But it isn't! I have a similar one and it actually works!
Jody: Rly? Can I come over someday and judge for myself?
Lynn: Sure! I'm doing the laundry tonight. If you have time tomorrow, pop in for a quick coffee ;)
Jody: Sure will! Thanks!
Lynn: No problem! Hope it makes your life easier :)
Jody: If it works as advertised, surely will!
Lynn: Believe me! It does!
Jody: Tomorrow around 2:00?
Lynn: Sure. Will be waiting.
Jody: See you then.

",Harvey and Carol are going skiing next Saturday because Harvey has to work this week. The resort is three hours away. Harvey will drive and Carol will pay for gas and snacks. Jon and Amanda might join them. Nobody except Harvey has skied before. He knows how to play hockey and skate too.
"Jan: Guys... the landlord has just published her review of us. It's I-N-S-A-N-E <file_photo>
Emma: Give me a sec
Ricardo: FUCK
Emma: I especially like the bit about Janek being ""sombre"" and ""exceptionally rude""
Jan: omg was I?
Emma: Hmmmm well, I bet it's one of these cultural differences... As a Spaniard she probably expected you to become her best friend and have a friendly chat about the weather... Instead, you greeted her enumerating all the faults of the apartment (which I would also do, but I understand if it was too much for her).
Jan: Well then, I'll write to her and apologise, perhaps she'll change the review?
Emma: I doubt it, but you can try if you have a moment to spare. Again, I don't really think you've done anything wrong, but upon some consideration, she might have misunderstood our non-Spanish behaviour
Jan: Yeah, I think you're right. Also, I assume this thing about cigarette fags all over the balcony is yet another delusion of hers?
Emma: Fuuuck. I actually might have left some... I was so tired in the morning I didn't even think about that. I'm so sorry guys 😭
Jan: Well, it looks like we deserve the shitty review and there's not much we can do about it, can we?
Ricardo: Hmmm, yeah, you might be right. In any case it's only one negative review by a silly old woman, I don't really think it'll ruin our lives
Jan: I feel like it'll totally ruin mine 💩
Emma: Change your name to Juan as I've been suggesting for years
Jan: 😂
Ricardo: When life gives you lemons, change your name to Juan
Emma: And your life will be much fun lalalalaaaa 🎵

Julia: Weird prank? Got the wrong door?
Todd: Perhaps. Do you have a camera outside yours?
Julia: I think there's on in the hall that catches my door. Never actually had to pull any tapes so not sure if it even works
Todd: I see. I'm about to drop a couple hammers on the BoD and mgmt ahead of the meeting. Will copy all to FB.

",James is applying for a sales position and is looking for tips how to do well at an interview. 
"Helena: Hi Wanda, how is Uni going?
Wanda: Pretty well, but the deadlines are doing my head in, so much fucking work!
Helena: I see you've started swearing like a typical student! My language got really bad last year!
Wanda: Yeah, I remember! I was shocked, but everyone does it here!
Helena: Here too, only with Scottish accent as well, it did take me a few months to get used to it!
Wanda: You're a lot braver than me, I only went about 15 miles to Leeds.
Helena: Yep, you didn't move out of West Yorks even!
Wanda: Well, I prefer it! I can even go and work in the petrol station till 10pm and pop home on the late train if I want to, saves me food money to have a day or two of home cooking, plus it's a lot nicer.
Helena: I know what you mean! I can't be arsed to peel veg and stuff like that, I exist on take aways and convenience micro meals, not good!
Wanda: Have you got I to the famous Scottish deep fried Mars bar craze?
Helena: 🤣I have had one, but Edinburgh is a bit posher than Glasgow where it's more popular. Do like square sausage and cloutie dumpling, though!
Wanda: You'll have to initiate me into these delicacies when I come visit.
Helena: You bet! When can you make it? 
Wanda: Well, I have two days off lectures at the end of next week and I can swap my shifts around if I do it tomorrow. I reckon I can train it up next Thurs if that suits you.
Helena: Should be fine! I have got lectures Friday mind, you could try a bit of sightseeing, perhaps?
Wanda: I would love to see the Castle and the National Art Gallery, have a wee look round too, hen!
Helena: Don't start trying to act all Scottish, you sassenach!
Wanda: Not sure what that means, but you're a Yorkshire lass too and you do it!
Helena: Yes, but I'm an adopted Scottish person now. I'd really like to stay on here, maybe do a PGCE.
Wanda: You a teacher! You haven't got the bloody patience to deal with kids all day!
Helena: Maybe, but it's an idea I've been toying with, convey my passion for history to the young!
Wanda: Hopefully, the young will share your enthusiasm!
Helena: Well, we'll see, still got over a year to decide!
Wanda: Think about it carefully, my sister teaches Geography over in Brighouse, as you know. She's only been doing it 3 years and she feels burnt out at the end of term!
Helena: Oh yeah, forgot about that! Anyway, keep me posted about next weekend, can't wait to see you if you can manage it!
Wanda: Me too, bye Chuck!
Helena: Bye 😗!","# ::tok Helena : Hi Wanda , how is Uni going ? Wanda : Pretty well , but the deadlines are doing my head in , so much fucking work !

Ursula: Shall I bring over a take away or a bottle of wine?
Craig: No need, pizzas ordered and I'm well stocked with wine, as usual!
Ursula: Great, I'll pop over then, give me 15 mins.

Rasha: What happened? 
Lisha: don't know, one second I was working and then I got a blue screen and it said ""dumping memory""
Rasha: Can't be good. I know they do repairs at those big box electronic stores, you can try there.
Lisha: I don't wanna pay an arm and a leg, though. Know any local mom and pop shops?
Rasha: There's a little electronics shop near my house, but I don't know if they repair computers.
Lisha: What's it called?
Rasha: I don't know. T&T or something. The next time I head out, I'll check for you. Or better yet, I'll drop in and ask them.
Lisha: Cool, thx a ton. Can you do it today? I'm in dire need...
Rasha: Yeah, sure. I'm going shopping in a bit, so I'll call you and let you know.
Lisha: Alright! In the meantime, can I borrow your computer :)
Rasha: Yeah, I don't really need it. You want me to bring it to school? The only thing is that it's quite slow.
Lisha: That'd be great. I don't care. I'm just gonna be using Word. I have to write that report on aboriginals.
Rasha: I finished that last week. You wanna see mine? Don't copy, though :)
Lisha: :-o I wouldn't dare
Rasha: :)
Lisha: See ya, I'll call you in a bit and let you know about that store.

Wilson: There was some turbulence on the flight, but nothing serious ;)
Leah: Sweet! Looks like they're really pampering you.
Wilson: Yeah, seems that way :)
Wilson: Although tomorrow we'll be spending the entire day on the pitch so I don't know if I'll get to enjoy it as much as I would like.
Leah: Well make the most of it love :)
Wilson: I was actually thinking that maybe you'ld like to come back here with me :) I could show you the sights, tell you what knowledge I've gleamed from the locals ;)
Leah: That sounds really nice actually. I've always wanted to go to Barcelona with a hot guy on my arm ;)
Wilson: Don't worry, I'll be your arm candy any time :P
Leah: Oh please - you'll be much more than that. I'm counting on you to be my personal masseuse and to carry my luggage.
Wilson: My girlfriend - the diva.

"Leu: How are you? Any new development about the house?
Luisa: Hello my dear!  Sadly not. No news at all regarding the house :(( We'll be sitting on it till the end of our lives!
Leu: That can't be. It is such a fantastic property. In such an incredibly beautiful estate. It's a matter of time.
Luisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market.
Leu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland.
Luisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night.
Leu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he?
Luisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?!
Leu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight.
Luisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples.
Leu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor.
Luisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him.
Leu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it?
Luisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day.
Leu: Therapy?
Luisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't.
Leu: Nor can I.
Luisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late.
Leu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.
Luisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...
Leu: Right you are! ""The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different."" Do you remember?

Bill: just remember that if you have a GeForce card it will not work with FreeSync
Steve: is that a problem?
Bill: it will work as a display, you just won't be able to activate this technology
Bill: I did found something more worrying 
Bill: there's lots of reviews about frequent bad pixels in this model and issues with the power supply

Sarah: Oh hi :) Sorry I just came back, stayed longer to strech a bit more.
Sarah: In general I enjoyed it. Our new instructor took it easy and I was a bit bored. But I love the atmosphere there.
Nina: Not challenging enough?
Sarah: Well, you know me, if I'm not sweating it's not a good training 😄
Sarah: I've heard you wanted to start moving. Join me next time!
Nina: I was hoping you'd ask me 😁 I wanna give it a try.
Sarah: Cool.
Sarah: It's either mondays 6pm, or thursdays at 7.
Nina: You can choose, both days work for me.
Sarah: Good. Then we go mondays AND thursdays! 😜
Nina: Are you trying to kill me??
Sarah: Drama queen. 😘 You'll be fine!
Nina: OK, so what do I need?
Sarah: For yoga class? A lot of determination haha
Sarah: Comfy clothes, water and a towel

"Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video? 
Max: <link_video>
Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an ""occasional low cumulative"", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.
Max: Tom You didn’t watch the video.
Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)
Jason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well.
Daniel: Short attention span 😊
Max: Daniel probably from pot 🤷‍♂️
Max: Jason he does - rewatch the end man. He doesn’t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other. 
David: Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco.
Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???
Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?
David: I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...
Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.
Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine
Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.
Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it.
Mark: Cannabis does not have a bad affect on the lungs!!
Virginia: MJ users will not believe anything bad. They think it is right up there with kale and swiss chard!","# ::tok Max : Din anyone actually watch this the video ?

",Carla's date for graduation is on June 4th. Diego will try to come then.
"Gita: Hello, this is Beti's Mum Gita, I wanted to ask if you were going on the school trip?
Bev: Hi Gita, yes, Milo wants me to come, he's a bit nervous going away from home or school still.
Gita: Yes, Beti is the same, they are still only 4 or 5 after all.
Bev: I know, still so young! It will help the teachers and TAs anyway, they have a lot to cope with!
Gita: I know, I could never do their job! I work part time as a music teacher, going round schools.
Bev: Oh really? I am in Marks, part time too, love it there! 
Gita: Yes, it really helps to do some sort of work doesn't it! I could never manage full time, though.
Bev: Oh, I know, Gita. My sister's in management and she doesn't see her kids from 6.30am to 6.30pm every day! She is a high flier, but she does miss them. She does do lots with them on the weekend, though.
Gita: Yes, but children need time to just be at home and play or just be with family, not galavanting around all the time!
Bev: I agree 100%! Is Beti looking forward to feeding the lambs and seeing the baby animals on the farm, Milo is very excited.
Gita: Oh yes! She loves animals, we have a few pets at home.
Bev: Well, we only have fish, they are pretty but not very interesting!
Gita: Suppose you're right! What time do we have to be at school on Wednesday?
Bev: Quite early, I think about 7.45, the bus leaves at 8 and we get to Holly Farm about 10, I think.
Gita: Hope the rain keeps off, especially if it's outdoors. I'll check their website.
Bev: Yes, good idea. Anyway, see you Weds, Gita!
