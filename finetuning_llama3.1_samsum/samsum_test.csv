",Jane is in Warsaw. Ollie and Jane has a party. Jane lost her calendar. They will get a lunch this week on Friday. Ollie accidentally called Jane and talked about whisky. Jane cancels lunch. They'll meet for a tea at 6 pm.

Elliot: I'm ok. We're meeting for the drinks in the evening anyway and I guess we'll be going back to the apartment together?
Hilary: Yeah, I guess so
Daniel: I'm with Hilary atm and won't let go of her for the rest of the day, so any option you guys choose is good for me
Benjamin: Hmm I might actually pass by at lunchtime, take the keys and go take a nap. I'm sooo tired after yesterday
Hilary: Sounds good. We'll be having lunch with some French people (the ones who work on the history of food in colonial Mexico - I already see you yawning your head off)
Benjamin: YAAAAWN 🙊 Where and where are you meeting?
Hilary: So I'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we'll head to this place called La Cantina. Italian cuisine, which is quite funny, but that's what they've chosen
Benjamin: Interesting 😱 To be honest, Hilary, I almost feel like changing my mind. Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear
Hilary: Oh come on 😂
Benjamin: All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take
Hilary: We'll try to avoid talking about their subject of research. Oh wait, no, I'm actually meeting them because I wanted to chat about their research lol
Elliot: 🙉
Hilary: Do join us, we're going to have fun. And then you'll take the keys and take this most deserved of naps

I 'm sooo tired after yesterday Hilary : Sounds good . We 'll be having lunch with some French people ( the ones who work on the history of food in colonial Mexico - I already see you yawning your head off ) Benjamin : YAAAAWN 🙊 Where and where are you meeting ? Hilary : So I 'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we 'll head to this place called La Cantina . Italian cuisine , which is quite funny , but that 's what they 've chosen Benjamin : Interesting 😱 To be honest , Hilary , I almost feel like changing my mind . Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear Hilary : Oh come on 😂 Benjamin : All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take Hilary : We 'll try to avoid talking about their subject of research . Oh wait , no , I 'm actually meeting them because I wanted to chat about their research lol Elliot : 🙉 Hilary : Do join us , we 're going to have fun . And then you 'll take the keys and take this most deserved of naps Elliot : Sounds like a plan 😂 Hilary : 😎 Elliot : See you at 2 then xx

",Igor has a lot of work on his notice period and he feels demotivated. John thinks he should do what he has to do nevertheless. 
"Clara: Hi, what you up to?
Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.
Clara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!
Neela: See ya, love!

"Deirdre: Hi Beth, how are you love?
Beth: Hi Auntie Deirdre, I'm been meaning to message you, had a favour to ask.
Deirdre: Wondered if you had any thought about your Mum's 40th, we've got to do something special!
Beth: How about a girls weekend, just mum, me, you and the girls, Kira will have to come back from Uni, of course.
Deirdre: Sounds fab! Get your thinking cap on, it's only in 6 weeks! Bet she's dreading it, I remember doing that!
Beth: Oh yeah, we had a surprise party for you, you nearly had a heart attack! 
Deirdre: Well, it was a lovely surprise! Gosh, thats nearly 4 years ago now, time flies! What was the favour, darling?
Beth: Oh, it was just that I fancied trying a bit of work experience in the salon, auntie.
Deirdre: Well, I am looking for Saturday girls, are you sure about it? you could do well in the exams and go on to college or 6th form.
Beth: I know, but it's not for me, auntie, I am doing all foundation papers and I'm struggling with those.
Deirdre: What about a tutor? Kira could help you in the hols.
Beth: Maybe, but I'd like to try working. I'm 16 soon, I'm old enough.
Deirdre: I know. Look, pop in tomorrow after school and we'll have a cuppa and a chat.
Beth: Yes, thanks auntie. I'd really like to try the beauty therapy side.
Deirdre: Its not for the squeamish, mind. Massage, pedicures, not to mention waxing!
Beth: Oh yes, I was chatting to a friend about it yesterday!
Deirdre: Maxine manages the beauty side, you can meet her tomorrow and we'll see how it goes.
Beth: Yes, I'd really like that. 
Deirdre: We can try a few hours on a Saturday for a couple of weeks as work experience. I'll give you a tenner or so per session to start off for your lunch, coffee and bus fare etc. If you like, we'll take it from there.
Beth: OK, I like the sound of it! See you tomorrow Auntie! Love you!

",Gloria has an exam soon. It lasts 4 hours. Emma sent her a link to a website with some texts from previous years so that she can prepare for the exam better.
"Adam: Have you talked to May?
Karen: Yes, yesterday, why?
Adam: I just talked to her and I must admit I worry about her
Karen: Me too, I suggested she should see a specialist, but she wasn't very happy about it
Adam: No wonder...
Karen: I know, but I think this is serious. She's saying she's depressed, like everyone around, but in her case it may be true
Adam: She was telling me she doesn't feel like doing anything, she's bored all the time, she never feels happy. It sounds like a real, typical depression
Adam: She also told me that she has trouble sleeping. I asked her to go out for a beer or anything basically, but she doesn't want to leave the flat
Karen: Oh my, it sounds really serious. I don't what to tell you
Adam: I was wondering how I can help her
Karen: Honestly I don't know if we can help her, Adam. I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I'm afraid we may unintentionally make it worse
Adam: Yes, but she doesn't want to see a specialist. Basically, she doesn't want to see anyone
Karen: Hm... I don't know... How about I call someone for advice? So we could know what to do
Adam: Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? Don't mention her name
Karen: Of course I won't! I have a friend who's a psychologist, we can trust her. I'll let you know

",Emma is about to take a nap in the back of the bus to New York. Ben and Emma will be there around 4.30 pm. Ben will wake Emma up 15 minutes prior to their arrival.
"Jesse: I have an idea that'll cheer u up!
Melvin: What is it?
Jesse: I was thinking about doing something 4 the less fortunate this year. 
Lee: Gr8 idea! Anything in mind?
Maxine: So no presents 4 me? :(
Jesse: U'll get ur presents, no worries ;)
Maxine: Phew! Was getting a bit worried for a moment ;)
Melvin: Bt what do u have in store?
Jesse: Well, have u heard about the Refuge?
Lee: No. What's that?
Melvin: That's the Christmas foundation to help women and children?
Maxine: I think I've heard of them. So what about them?
Jesse: That's right! They help women and children who escape from abuse. And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and I thought that we could choose one and chip in. 
Melvin: That's a great idea!
Lee: Count me in!
Maxine: Me too.
Jesse: Have a look at these 3 lists: <file_other> <file_other> <file_other>
Lee: I think the second one would be the easiest to arrange.
Maxine: Agree.
Melvin: What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage.
Jesse: Actually, I'm in for the 3rd one.
Maxine: I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it.
Melvin: But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. 
Lee: Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go. 
Jesse: So it's settled?
Melvin: Yup.

Kate : <file_photo> Kate : Good old Momo ! Yes , it is your scarf ! Ola : NO !!! It 's one of my favorites ! The one from Laos ! Kate : Too late . Momo thinks it belongs to her now . Get yourself a new one . They surely have nice ones there . Ola : Not at all . Only cheapish cotton blouses with horrible multi - coloured embroidery or some equally horrible crochetted tops . No shawls or scarfs . Ola : <file_photo> Kate : Wait a sec ! Kate : <file_photo> Kate : Is n't it similar ? ! Mum would probably like it . Why do n't you ? Ola : Not a bad idea . But the quality is usually crappy . Kate : And if you go to some boutique shop or something ? Not at a market as in your pics ? Ola : I might try and find some . Would you like one too ? Kate : Not really . And Mum would prefer to be the only one with an authentic Cuban blouse :) ) Ola : OK I 'll have a look . Greets to everyone at home pls . Kate : Take care !

"Jen: I think I'm through with the dickhead. He's being a pain again. I'm going to tell him to move out.
Jane: Did he at least give you back the money he owes you?
Jen: No. He's freeloading and said he has no intention of giving back my money because I don't deserve it with the way I act.
Jane: He has a nerve doesn't he? How dare he?!!!
Jen: I've learnt to hate him with a passion. He's like vermin that you can't cull.
Jen: Abusive, nasty, annoying, irresponsible. He disgusts me.
Jane: Get rid of him! I told you right from the beginning that he's no good.
Jen: Yeah you were absolutely right.. as always.
Jane: I hate to say it but I can smell a fucktard a mile away.
Jen: I seem to pick them, don't I?
Jen: Sometimes I think it is my fault. If only I could be a better person, if only, if only....
Jane: You know that way of thinking will get you nowhere fast. It's self defeating. That's what the abusers want you think that you're bad and you deserve every bit of abuse that they dish out.
Jen: What if he doesn't leave? I'm afraid of asking him to leave 'cause it will only cause another fight.
Jane: You can't spend your whole life walking on eggshells.
Jen: Yeah, you're right... but how do I get out of this mess?
Jane: I think you've got to cut your losses and just move on.
Jen: Easier said than done.

"Andrew: Hello Bez, this morning I wanted to take your car and go to Krizingen but it showed ""low  brake fluid level"". So I went only to the garage next to Willig and they said it's ok, probably a display error. Do you want me to have the car checked properly? Have you got a contract with some garage in particular?
Andrew: Kate took your car today, just to check, and everything was fine. It must have been in fact display error.
Andrew: Hi Bez, when are you back? What date?
Bez: Hello Andy and Kate! Sorry for not replying immediately. We have here no wifi internet connection. I'm in a hotel lobby now and use a ""phone credit"".
Bez: The car should be ok as it passed general inspection only in June. I usually go to a garage in Crinch. But don't bother as long it shows no more alarms.
Bez: Apart from that is everything alright? Automatic lights going on and off? One downstairs, one upstairs.
Bez: Please don't forget to give the plants in the basement an occasional drink! Thank you.
Bez: I'm home on the 21st in the evening. Could you please switch the heating on a bit on that day?
Andrew: Hello Bez, just as we thought. No internet. Everything is fine here, also the car. The plants in the basement are watered once a week but not too much.

Julia: Rly?

Julia: Rly? Intriguing.
Gail: I know! :) and Jessica is thinking about going on diet.
Julia: Wasn't she on one already?
Gail: Nah. Whenever she posts a lot of fitness-related stuff, she's just thinking about, but doing nothing rly. 
Julia: I always thought she was training day and night!
Gail: Nah. That's just how she is. The more she posts, the less she does. Like she had a phase for animal shelters. Remember?
Julia: Yeah. She just wouldn't shut up about it. She posted every single thing she could find on the subject!
Gail: Right. And turned out that was everything she did. Never visited one. Never donated a dime. Never did anything.
Julia: And all the time I thought she was so active and pro-active and charitable. She had me fooled ;)
Gail: U see? Spying on ppl is fun :)
Julia: Speaking of which, did u spy on me?
Gail: No, y would I?
Julia: It's fun?
Gail: Oh no! Don't get me wrong! We talk all the time, so no need to spy on u ;)
Julia: Gr8.
Gail: Besides ur pretty straightforward.
Julia: What do u mean?
Gail: When ur eating, u post food. When ur training, u post fitness materials or photos. When ur relaxing, u post a bunch of stuff.
Julia: I know :) that's y ppl like what I do, 'caus I genuine :)

Hank: Yeah, I guess. So apparently the tests are supposed to last 5-8 pm. 3 hours! I'll probably wait and work on the computer.
Don: Bring a blanket :) It can get mighty cold sitting in a rink for 3 hours.
Hank: No shit :) Are you coming.
Don: Well, since you're going anyway, maybe you can take my kid :) 
Hank: Hey, that's not fair! 
Don: I'll take the kids next time, I promise!
Hank: Yeah, yeah, we'll see. I'll tell you about the tests when I bring Oscar and Roger back.
Don: Ok, thanks again, I owe you.","# ::tok Don : The CSS tests are today . Hank : I know ! Have you registered in their system ? Don : No , not yet . Hank : I 'm not sure if I have to fill out all the fields . Most of them do n't even apply to Rodney . It 's strange that they 're incorporating such professional tests for little leaguers . Don : Hmm ... I do n't know . I 'll check it later tonight when I get home . Apparently it 's supposed to be a database of all the young up - and - coming hockey stars . Scouts use that information for future contracts , etc. Hank : OK , but our kids are 10 years old !

Mitch: I'm doing well - pretty tired. Yes, I do think that's possible :)
Rory: Great, that would mean a lot to us. Thanks a lot. 
Mitch: That'd be wonderful! July, I'll be at a few camps ;)
Rory: Of course, we'll chip in for gas. Ok, no problem :)
Mitch: Thx, no worries. I hope you're all doing well. Time is flying by ;)
Rory: Ok, great. I know, it's crazy.
Rory: Do you know exactly which date you'll be leaving?
Mitch: Sunday, the 29th
Rory: Ok, cool. It's such a long drive.
Mitch: Yeah, around 1000 km, but I'll try to get there early Mon morning.
Rory: That's a pretty ambitious undertaking :)
Mitch: I have to, camp starts Mon 9.
Rory: Just be careful, and take lots of breaks, don't fall asleep at the wheel, etc.
Mitch: I'll have the boys to keep me awake, and lots of snacks :)
Rory: Ok. We will probably put Bill on a Flixbus, so he'll arrive around 10 am Sun
Mitch: Cool, just make sure he has his phone on him.
Rory: Ok, no problem. We'll give him your number, but most likely Joanna will be picking him up.
Mitch: Oh, ok. That makes things easier. I'll meet him after.
Rory: Great, thanks a lot for doing this, I don't know how else we would get him down to Croatia.
Mitch: No problem. Talk to you later.

"Nancy: Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;)
Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not.
Nancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?
Phil: Probably so. Not sure, though.
Nancy: How about u, Vic?
Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.
Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. 
Vic: What do u mean?
Phil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.
Vic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.
Phil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.
Nancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?
Vic: I do. 
Phil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. 
Nancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.
Phil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. 
Vic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!
Phil: So, what else?
Vic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)
Phil: And does this motivate u to train?
Vic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. 
Nancy: What do u think about Tumblr?
Phil: What?
Vic: Heard about it, but never had an account.
Nancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!
Phil: Don't have that much time to write a blog.
Vic: Me neither. 
Phil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;)

Catherine: R u still working there?
Jake: I sure am. It's already been 5 yrs.
Catherine: Time flies. So I take it ur satisfied?
Jake: I am, I rarely think about changing companies. 
Catherine: Does the company offer possibilities of personal development & promotion?
Catherine: I mean is there a clear career path?
Jake: Yup, that's the main pro of this place & the benefits.
Jake: I was promoted twice during these 5 yrs & the salary increase with each promotion is quite significant.
Catherine: That's good to hear. Most companies 2day are implementing cost saving policies & the employees are the ones who suffer.
Catherine: I mean at my current workplace u can only count on inflation salary increases. So u barely see the difference on ur paycheck.
Jake: That's what I hear from most of my friends. It's a tough time 4 employees on the market nowadays.
Jake: 4 now our company is still dynamically expanding. 
Catherine: And how about the benefits u mentioned?
Jake: The company partially finances language & accounting courses.
Jake: There's also a yearly bonus that depends on your achievements and private healthcare.
Catherine: That sounds like a dream :D Your HR dept. gave me a call yesterday and invited me to an interview on Monday.
Jake: That's great! I'll keep my fingers crossed :)
Catherine: Thanks Jake :) Is there anything I should prepare/review before the interview?
Jake: Well I think it would be beneficial to know some facts about the company.
Jake: You can find them on the official website, in the ""about us"" section:  <file_other> 
Catherine: OK, I'll definitely take a look.
Jake: And they may ask u some Qs about accounting principles, the basics. But I mean that won't be a problem 4 u.

"Clint: I'm curious. How's the waste management working out over there?

Clint: Sheer curiosity. What about general awareness? Plastic bags, etc.?
Ronnie: Very high. No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. No more straws in restaurants.
Clint: Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. I wonder when that will get here.
Ronnie: Never...

Ronnie: I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. People there live in a different world when it comes to that.
Clint: People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. It's above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow
Ronnie: That is true. But at the state government level I don't think there is that awareness either. But hopefully I am proven wrong!

"Noah: Hi there! The quince we talked about the other day... Are you still interested?
Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.
Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.
Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.
Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?
Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.
Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.
Noah: OK.
Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?
Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!
Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.
Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.
Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?
Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.
Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?
Noah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!

",Olivia has to sort out her accounts and upload a few videos on YouTube. Jake is complaining that Sony Music tried to appropriate his own music.
"Emily: Oh Linda...Something horrible has happened. I'm so sorry. I have broken one of your green tea cups. Just looked away and brushed it off the table with my skirt. SORRY!
Linda: No worries babe! It's nothing. Really.
Emily: I'm feeling so bad about it. So clumsy of me.
Linda: Look. I never really liked the set, so one cup makes no difference. I hardly use it anyway. How come it was on the table BTW?
Emily: I was cleaning the cupboards in the dining room.
Linda: You did what? Whatever for? The crockery there is more for decoration.
Emily: Exactly. I thought they're so pretty, especially the green ones, and then noticed how dusty they are. So I thought I'd be a helpful guest and wash them. I did. And then I made myself a cuppa in the green one. And it happened.
Linda: Ya golden! Really! Look, calm down. You are a fantastic guest.
Emily: Ya. Smashing. As we say in GB.
Linda: You know what? Take out the whole green set. If you like it so much - it is yours.
Emily: But Linda! I'm speechless.
Linda: Precious! See you in the evening!

"Brett: So what do u do there? Drive a tank all the time?

Andrew: Sensible. Unlike WoW.

Andrew: Well, open world, u can team up with anyone, do quests together, arrange fighting tactics and so on.
Brett: Actually, my cousin met his wife there :)
John: Rly?
Brett: Yeah. They were playing together for some time, talking and at some point he invited her to a date. Turned out they lived very close to each other ;)

"Rael: Gosh, I fucking hate my job!
Zach: Oops! Someone is in a mood...
Rael: I'm serious, I'm done. Those people are fucked up. I cannot stand it anymore.
Zach: Is it that bad?
Rael: Even worse...
Zach: What this time?
Rael: I don't even have time to eat my fucking lunch. It's not normal.
Zach: Did you talk to your manager?
Rael: Yeah, this retard doesn't get that we're humans not robots. I hate him.
Zach: You're gonna quit?
Rael: It's not that easy, I gotta find something. I don't want to leave without first finding a new job.
Zach: I see. Did you think about IT?
Rael: No, why?
Zach: Girl, it's the best place to work in! A lot of my friends started as software testers and they are really satisfied. Good money and no rat race.
Rael: Zach, are you crazy? I don't have technical studies.
Zach: You don't have to. If you have good analytical skills all you need is some online course - Udemy or something. People change their career after years of employment in totally different business. It's not that difficult, really. You should give it a try. Tech is our future.
Rael: Hmm... Maybe you're right. I'm still not sure what to do with my career, so... why not.
Zach: If you want, I can talk to my friends and they will give you some advice on how to start, what courses to choose and so on.
Rael: That would be great, thanks.

Mary: What was it this time?
Kate: Same thing, as always. Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him
Kate: I'm angry every single time I talk with him
Mary: Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say?
Kate: I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it
Mary: oh god
Kate: right?! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck
Mary: What did you tell him?
Kate: What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything.
Mary: I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that
Kate: Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once
Mary: I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him
Kate: Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself
Kate: I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US
Mary: Oh my god he said that?
Kate: Yes :/
Mary: Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much
Kate: You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him

Deborah: If Sofie wants to take the unicorn we won't have much space in the car XD
Nathan: No, I explained to her that he'll be fine without her these few days, I hope it worked :D
Deborah: We need to take boots and those warm jackets for the girls, my parents promised them to take them on a trip to the forest
Nathan: I remember, Lucy was really excited about that. Are we taking the bicycles?
Deborah: Yeah, don't you think we could use some alone time while the rest of the family is hiking? XD
Nathan: Now you're talking! We could have a ride to this beautiful cliff where we were last year!
Deborah: Why not, it's a wonderful idea! :*
Nathan: So tomorrow I'm seeing the dentist after work, you go to pick up the girls from school…
Deborah: Yeah, then we meet at home, have a quick bite (you probably won't, haha!)
Nathan: Thanks Honey, so nice of you to remind me of this! After the quick bite you girls have, we are off!
Deborah: Damn, I forgot to buy this syrup for travel sickness. Will you have time today to do it?
Nathan: Yes, it's feasible :) I'll do it on my way from work
Deborah: Wonderful! So see you in the evening then?

"Casper: Is any of you nobel fellows going for tomorrow's classes with Mr Linda?
Alexander: Hmm...
Alexander: To be or not to be, that is the question!
Alexander: But remembering the last lecture with Linda, my answer is like moving towards NO
Igor: Amen to that, Alex!
Igor: Last time I came so self-motivated and full of energy that I thought I could even dominate the lecture
Igor: I sat in the second row, concentrated, even took some notes and asked two questions
Igor: After few minutes Lewis poked me and told to stop snoring...
Casper: Ahahahaha
Casper: True, I saw that!
Alexander: I think it's not that the subjects themselves are boring, it must be his voice
Alexander: I mean it's so monotonous and hypnotic. Kind of... lulling you to sleep
Igor: Yeah, that guy is like David Copperfield among lecturers
Alexander: Haha David Copperfield :D
Alexander: Let's call him like that from now on! He even looks like the magician a little :D
Casper: That's a fancy nickname, I like it
Casper: But if I wanted to see a magician, I'd rather go to the circus

"Enrique: Thanks for sharing your collection with the class. They loved it!
Farrah: No problem! It was my pleasure!
Enrique: Not everyday you get to see some of those up close and personal like that. We were wowed!
Farrah: Oh, gee, that's so nice!
Enrique: You have a great collection, you should be proud!
Farrah: I am, but not everyone appreciates it.
Enrique: Fossils are a unique thing to collect, that's for sure.
Farrah: If you leave them sitting around, they just become dust magnets!
Enrique: So it's good to share them.
Farrah: Especially with little kids, they get so amazed! It was a fun day.
Enrique: It was for us as well! Will you come back again?
Farrah: Of course! Any time!
Enrique: I was thinking that our 4th grade students would like to check them out as well. Can I give your name and number to that teacher?
Farrah: Sure thing. 
Enrique: I'm not sure how it fits into the lesson plan, so they may not get in touch until next semester.
Farrah: Fair enough. No problem, I understand.
Enrique: Thanks again! It was really interesting!
Farrah: Of course! Any time, and now I have a better idea of other ones to bring next time.
Enrique: That would be great.
Farrah: Some of the questions really made me wish I had brought my whole collection, but that just isn't practical.
Enrique: Oh, I understand. I'm sure you'll do fine next time with whatever you bring.
Farrah: Thanks!

Mary: in a week! unbelievable 🎉
Patricia: I can't believe either. 
Patricia: I am also increasingly scared
Mary: you're such an alarmist!
James: But scared of what??
Patricia: the long flight, earth-quakes
Patricia: God, and tsunamis!
James: hahaha, you're really a damn alarmist
James: this is so exaggerated, are you serious?
Patricia: James, I almost never travel, I'm afraid really
James: Listen, nothing will happen. First of all the earthquakes happen rarely, even in Japan and only in certain places
James: it's not like the whole country is shaking all the time
Mary: I'm telling her this all the time, but it's pointless
James: And, most of all, Japanese have amazing architecture because of their experiences with earthquakes. Their cities are super safe
Patricia: What about tsunamis?
James: Are you going to be at the coast even?
Patricia: Mary, are we?
Mary: I doubt. maybe for 2 hours somewhere close to Tokyo
James: So I don't think the next tsunami in Japan will happen exactly at that place and time, relax and enjoy
James: Japan is really an amazing country.

Jake: I think it's a good idea to buy things that will serve you longer

Dick: It's the big on with the terrace, around 85 m
Frank: Grrr.... I'm jealous cause mine's only 65.
Dick: :)
Frank: If you decide to buy it, I have a contractor that does everything, and he's dirt cheap too!
Dick: Cool, I'll be putting most of my cash in as a down payment, so I won't have much left for renovations.
Frank: How much do you have, 10% or 15%.
Dick: We're putting down 10. We can get quite a good mortgage rate apparently.
Frank: Alright, sounds good. How many apts have you seen already?
Dick: This will be the first one in this neighbourhood.
Frank: But in total?
Dick: 5. We saw 2 last week and 3 last month, but nothing really appealing,
Frank: You're gonna love my area. It's so peaceful and tranquil.
Dick: I'm gonna have to liven up the place then :)
Frank: Ok, whatever. Don't forget to bring a measure. Do you have one of those electronic ones?
Dick: No
Frank: I'll bring one then. They're super cool and easy to use. You can plan each room by knowing the dimensions.

"Maria: Hi Spence, life treating you well?
Spencer: Can't complain love, lots of commissions coming in and all that!
Maria: Getting your name out there! Saw some of your new stuff on Instagram, liked it!
Spencer: Yeah, thanks love! How's the call centre?
Maria: Same old, same old. Can't wait to go part time next year, really want to get on with some freelancing.
Spencer: Yeah, pity they won't allow it for a year. I'm on 16 fixed hours at the cafe which suits me great. I've then got the rest of the week to work on my illustrations.
Maria: How do you get new clients, Spence? I really need to pick your brains sometimes!
Spencer: Well, some of them saw my printing in the shops I sell to and contacted me directly, then there's the agency and my social media stuff. I probably get around £1000  of work a month now, before commission and tax.
Maria: Well that's just about liveable with the cafe wage, I imagine.
Spencer: Yes, it's tight, but I am very frugal. Still have a hefty chunk going out on rent and bills.
Maria: Hmm, I'll have to budget carefully when I do it.
Spencer: Yes, but it's well worth it. I LOVE the work so much!
Maria: Well, your passion is obvious! Your stuff is amazing!
Spencer: Well, so was yours in Uni. Don't let your talent go to waste!
Maria: You've inspired me, Spence. See you soon, hopefully!
Spencer: See ya!","# ::tok Maria : Hi Spence , life treating you well ? Spencer : Ca n't complain love , lots of commissions coming in and all that ! Maria : Getting your name out there !

"Tim: Hey, you have a few minutes?
Joe: Sure, what's up?
Tim: I'm thinking about inviting a few people from work over and I kinda thought that maybe some boardgames would be a cool idea.
Tim: And I wanted to consult the expert on the matter :)
Joe: As you know I'm always happy to share my expertise with anyone willing to listen. You will just need to stop me when I get too wound up :D
Tim: Haha :) Ok, So I know you ran the local club - any tips how to organize a newbie gaming evening? And what games to bring?
Joe: yeah, sure - just a few general tips :)
Joe: Start games before you start drinking :) And don't bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. So no Game of Thrones :)
Joe: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic
Tim: Got it :D 
Joe: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into? 
Tim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... 
Joe: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life :)
Tim: Yeah, I know, all too well :)
Tim: Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start.
Joe: yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns :)
Tim: Will do that :)","# ::tok Tim : Hey , you have a few minutes ? Joe : Sure , what 's up ?

","Tilly was supposed to come home by 4 but she got a detention. The school was supposed to inform her parents about it, but didn't do it. Sam is coming back home. Tilly will be home in 40 minutes. She will call Sam then. "
"Mell: Hi there! How are you doing?
Gloria: Hi Mell! We are fine, just the daily grind ;) And yourselves?
Mell: Not much happening either. An odd phone call with the kids. Or Tad's sister:(( Not much otherwise.
Gloria: Yeah... Life has become so quite since the kids are out of the house. We had more to get used to it. But it must hard for you. Especially you I mean.
Mell: I don't know. Sometimes I even forget that I should be missing them. In a way I do like this peace and quiet now.
Gloria: Small wonder. You had a hell of a time with them just before they went to college. I'd say you need to recover now.
Mell: I guess you're right. But maybe I should feel guilty or something?
Gloria: Don't be silly! You are a fantastic mom.
Mell: Thanks Gloria.
Gloria: Anyway I'm happy to hear from you again. We should really have a nice do again.
Mell: YES! Splendid!
Gloria: The weather is just brilliant, perfect for a BBQ. What do you think?
Mell: I'm all for it. At my place? I'd love it.
Gloria: Can't be better. I love your garden.
Mell: We're thinking about extending the terrace. I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. It would be great to hear your opinion.
Gloria: I'd love to. But you know how little I know about garden design, or however you call it.
Mell: We'll have a look at them. Now the BBQ. At the weekend I suppose?
Gloria: Let me check the calendar. Here's our family planner. A horrible name, isn't it? So this weekend suits us fine. At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. So what about this Saturday?
Mell: Perfect. At least we know the weather holds. Shall I do the food and you the drinks?
Gloria: And I'll get us some dessert as well. 
Mell: Very good indeed. It's always so easy going with you.
Gloria: Ta! You were thinking about Tad's sister?
Mell: I'm afraid so. I'm so happy she moved up to Scotland and I don't have to put up with her trying to run my household. Tad feels relieved too.
Gloria: Good riddance! I could really never warm up to her.
Mell: Nobody can! Anyway she's gone and we're going to have a fantastic barbecue. Without her.
Gloria: Yes, we are. Oh I'm so happy you've phoned!
Mell: Looking forward to our BBQ on Saturday!
Gloria: So long!","# ::tok Mell : Hi there ! How are you doing ? Gloria : Hi Mell ! We are fine , just the daily grind ; ) And yourselves ? Mell : Not much happening either .

"Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. 
Betty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?
Andy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. 
Betty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!
Andy: No problem, speak soon.","# ::tok Andy : Hello . I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room . Betty : Hello Andy .

"Kate: I've just heard you want to sell your flat?!

Kate: Ha ha! I wish.. 
Rob: I'll give you a discount ;)
Kate: Sure. You moved in a year ago or so?! Why do you wanna sell it?
Rob: We're thinking about having a baby and it is too small.
Kate: It's not that bad. Mine is smaller and I have two.
Rob: There's no room for a cot in our bedroom.
Kate: You're right. So are you looking for two bed now?
Rob: Three bed would be perfect so that we won't have to move out again when we decide to have another baby. 
Kate: That's sounds reasonable.
Rob: I know. It just the prices.. total madness!!!
Kate: I can only imagine. It's getting more expensive year after year. 
Rob: I've got a friend who's relocating to another city so want to sell his flat ASAP and offers a good price. We're seeing him tomorrow.

Michael: yes asap
Kai: for the Netherlands?
Michael: maybe to recharge and look for jobs abroad, but I don't want to stay there. I know it’s not smart to quit without an alternative
Kai: depends on the field. I don't know yours and your experience. But it can be a bit stressful also
Michael: true, in my field it wouldn’t be good. Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. How’s everything on your side? too much work?
Kai: yes, I basically never rest these days

Josie: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy.
Stefano: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P
Josie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate.
Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.
Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?
Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.
Josie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s.
Stefano: Really? What did he say?
Josie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game.

Jess: I guess? 
Charlie: I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream.

",Jess dreamt she was a lion tamer. Lynn believes that dreams mean something. Charlie has read that strangers from our dreams are actually people who we've seen before.
"Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance?
Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death
Jack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong?
Charles: Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something
Monica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those articles:
Monica: <file_other>, <file_other>
Karen: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me
Karen: When it comes to intolerance... I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine
Jack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine
Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much
Karen: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better
Monica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now
Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?
Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens
Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare
Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm
Monica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat
Charles: Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me","# ::tok Charles : How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance ?
